"Mixin" layer for adding latest Go toolchain versions into the Yocto Project LTS.

At the time Kirkstone was released in May 2022, Go 1.17 was the latest version
and officially Kirkstone supports only that. This thin special-purpose mixin
layer is meant to address this issue by backporting Go recipes from the master
branch of openembedded-core.

The patches can be backport from openembedded-core with:

 git -C ../openembedded-core format-patch --stdout -1 origin/master meta/recipes-devtools/go | \
 git am --signoff -p4 --directory=recipes-devtools/go
